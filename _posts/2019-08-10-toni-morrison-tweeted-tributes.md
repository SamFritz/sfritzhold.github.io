Toni Morrison, one of the best and most influential literary writers of the 20th and 21st centuries, died on Monday. She was the first Black woman to win the Nobel Prize in literature and the author of eleven novels, dozens of essays, as well as literary criticism. When Morrison's publisher announced the news of her death on Tuesday morning, thousands of people began mourning her incredible life on Twitter. Within a little over a day, more than 500,000 Twitter users in fact cited Toni Morrison specifically by first and last name in a million tweets and retweets.

To preserve this powerful commemoration of a historic American author, I started collecting tweets that mentioned "Toni Morrison" with [twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc), a digital tool created by Ed Summers and [DocNow](https://www.docnow.io/). At the end of this blog post, I explain how you can access the [tweets from this archive](https://archive.org/details/toni-morrison-tweets)---only if the tweets are still public and have not been deleted by their creator---and I outline some ethical considerations and best practices if you plan to use this data.

But first I wanted to share a quick overview of the roughly one million tweets and retweets that paid tribute to Toni Morrison's life in the day after the news broke.

**Total Duration of this Snapshot:** 1 day, 3 hours  
**Earliest Tweet:**  9:08AM (CST) August 6, 2019         
**Latest Tweet:** 12:18PM (CST) August 7, 2019  
 
**Number of Tweets That Mentioned Toni Morrison:** 976,014[^1]                        
**Number of Twitter Users:**                510,093                          
**Number of Languages Used in Tweets:** 48  

[^1]: There were actually 1,001,518 tweets and retweets that mentioned Toni Morrison's name within this period. By the time that I began hydrating them on August 8, however, there were only 976,014 tweets that were still public and not deleted.

# Top 10 Most Retweeted

1. <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Toni Morrison was a national treasure, as good a storyteller, as captivating, in person as she was on the page.

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

    Former President Barack Obama's celebration of Morrison was the most widely recirculated tweet in the wake of her death, and it was shared over 50,000 times. The photo that he included of himself and Morrison was taken in 2012 on the day that she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the U.S.
    

2. <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One of my favorite interviews with Toni Morrison. The interviewer asked her when she was going to “substantially” write about white people. Her response? “You can’t understand how powerfully racist that question is, can you?” <a href="https://t.co/WFhNMgx7xv">pic.twitter.com/WFhNMgx7xv</a></p>&mdash; Paul McCallion (@OrangePaulp) <a href="https://twitter.com/OrangePaulp/status/1158752990876110850?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2019</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

   This video clip, in which Morrison confronts Australian journalist Jana Wendt for asking a "powerfully racist" question during their 1998 interview, was retweeted more than 50,000 times, and it was shared in many other tweets, as well. Quotations and video clips from Morrison's media appearances were extensively featured in tweets memorializing the author's life and career.  

3. <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Toni Morrison: 40<br>Mark Twain: 41<br>Marcel Proust: 43<br>Henry Miller: 44<br>JRR Tolkien: 45<br>Raymond Chandler: 51<br>Richard Adams: 52<br>Annie Proulx: 57<br>Laura Ingalls Wilder: 65<br>Frank McCourt: 66<br>Harriett Doerr: 74<br>Harry Bernstein: 96<br>No, you’re not too old to publish your first book.</p>&mdash; Allison K Williams (@GuerillaMemoir) <a href="https://twitter.com/GuerillaMemoir/status/1031295024984743937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

   Many tweets in the wake of Morrison's death reflected on the age at which she published her first novel, *The Bluest Eye* (1970), 40 years old. This particular tweet was first shared almost a year earlier and gained renewed momentum after Morrison's passing.

4. <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;If you can only be tall because somebody is on their knees, then you have a serious problem. And my feeling is white people have a very, very serious problem, and they should start thinking about what they can do about it.” <br><br>Rest In Power Toni Morrison<a href="https://t.co/KD0mukv4x0">pic.twitter.com/KD0mukv4x0</a></p>&mdash; Keith Boykin (@keithboykin) <a href="https://twitter.com/keithboykin/status/1158737452493934592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2019</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
   Another remediated television interview, a [1993 conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGeNJewyo4o) between Morrison and Charlie Rose, also became a popular source for Twitter users venerating Toni Morrison. Many users particularly latched onto her claim during this interview that "[i]f you can only be tall because someone else is on their knees, then you have a serious problem."

5. <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“He licked his lips. ‘Well, if you want my opinion-‘<br>‘I don’t, ‘ She said. ‘I have my own.”<br>— Toni Morrison, BELOVED</p>&mdash; Saeed Jones (@theferocity) <a href="https://twitter.com/theferocity/status/1158733930658455554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2019</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    This excerpt from Morrison's Pulitzer-Prize-winning novel *Beloved* (1997) comes from an exchange between Paul D. and Denver near the end of the narrative. It is notable that this quotation is taken from a work of Morrison's fiction---with the trappings of third-person narration and dialogue---since the other most retweeted quotations were cribbed from nonfictional television interviews. 

6. <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“If you can only be tall because someone else is on their knees, then you have a serious problem.

7. <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The best way to honour Toni Morrison is to continue her legacy by celebrating and supporting Black female writers. So here’s a thread of fantastic women whose work you should read.</p>&mdash; Sister Outrider (@ClaireShrugged) <a href="https://twitter.com/ClaireShrugged/status/1158780575202852864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2019</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
   A significant number of the tweets in this archive, such as the one featured above, praised Morrison as a central node in a literary network of Black women writers. This tweet made the network explicit as well as expanded it by tagging the Twitter user names of dozens of Black women authors in a 20-plus-part thread.

8. <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“if you can only be tall because somebody’s on their knees, you have a serious problem.” - toni morrison <a href="https://t.co/MEIt2iEynH">pic.twitter.com/MEIt2iEynH</a></p>&mdash; nadirah (@hinadirah) <a href="https://twitter.com/hinadirah/status/1158733669923770368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2019</a></blockquote>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

   Like the #2 most retweeted Toni Morrison citation, the above tweet also included a video clip from Morrison's 1998 interview with Jana Wendt. Like #3, it was also a tweet first published months earlier, back in February 2019. This pattern makes clear that some Toni Morrison tweets and videos had long circulating lives on the internet and that they took on renewed significance in the wake of Morrison's death.

# Top 5 Novel Titles Mentioned in Tweets

Many of the Twitter users featured in this archive shouted out their first-read, favorite, or most memorable Toni Morrison novel by name. To see which novels were mentioned the most, I identified tweets that included Morrison's fiction titles in a capitalized or all-caps form (generally indicating the proper noun usage of the word or words).

<a href="/images/morrison/top_5_novels_toni_morrison_tweets.png"><img  width='100%' alt="Common Quotations in Toni Morrison Tweets" src="/images/morrison/top_5_novels.png"></a>


The top five Morrison novels mentioned on Twitter after her death appeared to be *Beloved* (1987), *Song of Solomon* (1977), *The Bluest Eye* (1970), *Sula* (1973), and *A Mercy* (2008). All eleven of Morrison's novels were mentioned within these roughly million tweets, however, and you can also explore a <a href="/images/morrison/all_novels_toni_morrison_tweets.png">bar chart that compares mentions of all her novels</a>.

# Top Tweets From Most Followed Accounts

Toni Morrison was a truly colossal public figure. So I was also interested in seeing which other highly  influential public figures were discussing her after her death. The Twitter accounts with the most followers that also tweeted about Morrison between August 6-7 were Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Oprah, *The New Yorker*, Bernie Sanders, NPR, Common, Kerry Washington, and Bill Clinton.

# To Access the Toni Morrison Tweet Archive

Twitter's terms of service do not allow tweet datasets to be shared openly on the web, but they do allow for the sharing of unique identifiers, which are tethered to every tweet and which can be used to access an original tweet if that tweet is still public and has not been deleted yet. This policy, [as DocNow puts it](https://www.docnow.io/catalog/), "speaks to users rights as content creators, while also allowing researchers to share their data with others." Accordingly, I have shared a [data set](https://archive.org/details/toni-morrison-tweets) of 1,170,032 unique identifiers for tweets that mentioned "Toni Morrison" with or without a space between August 6 and August 9, 2019 on the Internet Archive. It will also be available through [DocNow's Tweet ID Catalogue](https://www.docnow.io/catalog/). 

If you want to access and analyze this data yourself, you can do so with [twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc) or the desktop application, [Hydrator](https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator) (and the "hydration" process is explained in greater detail in both places). If you choose to use this data, I highly recommend consulting [DocNow's white paper](https://www.docnow.io/docs/docnow-whitepaper-2018.pdf) about archiving social media content, especially their concluding recommendations:

>1. Archivists	should	engage	and	work	with	the	communities	they	wish	to	document.
>2. Documentation	efforts	must	go	beyond	what	can	be	collected	without	permission	
from	the	web	and	social	media.
>3. Archivists	should	follow	social	media	platforms’	terms	of	service	where	they	are	
congruent	with	the	values	of	the	communities	they	are	attempting	to	document.	
>4. When	possible,	archivists	should	apply	traditional	archival	practices	such	as	
appraisal,	collection	development,	and	donor	relations	to	social	media	and	web	
materials.	

# Reconstituting and Rereading Toni Morrison

The loss of Toni Morrison is a profound one. Like so many others, I am drawn to Obama's widely recirculated words to put this loss into perspective. It really does feel like a "gift" to have "breathe[d] the same air" as the great Toni Morrison, "if only for a while." It's hard to imagine that a more major literary figure will be alive again during my lifetime.

But it is also profound to have witnessed so many people testifying to Morrison's literary influence and legacy this week, to have seen such sincere interest in her life and work, and to have observed the author reconstituted by those mourning and celebrating her on Twitter. These Twitter users collectively grieved Morrison---the author of deep, [difficult](https://slate.com/culture/2019/03/toni-morrison-difficulty-black-women.html), and complex narratives---in the necessarily reductive form of 240-character tweets, photos, and video clips, and they often did so with creativity, beauty, and power.

Many of these Twitter users also spoke about returning to Morrison's difficult novels (or essays or literary criticism) or about wanting to dive into them for the first time. There have been many ["essential" Toni Morrison reading lists](https://time.com/5645078/toni-morrison-books/) published in the last few days, but I wanted to conclude by offering a short round-up of further scholarly reading on Morrison to also direct people to the work of scholars who have been studying and attending to Toni Morrison's life and literature for many years now.
