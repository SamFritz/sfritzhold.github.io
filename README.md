Welcome to my site, [samfritz.github.io](https://samfritz.github.io) where I'm experimenting with building a Jekyll site and hosting through GitHub pages.

Inspiration taken from the personal website of Melanie Walsh: https://melaniewalsh.org/. Powered by Jekyll and the Jekyll theme Minimal Mistakes, designed by Michael Rose.
