## Mapping the Librotraficante Movement

An interactive ‚Äústory map‚Äù of the [2012 Librotraficante caravan](http://www.librotraficante.com/Caravan-Sked.html) that combines a geographic map with a corresponding multimedia narrative. The multimedia narrative contains textual descriptions of stops along the route as well as snippets of some of the digital content produced there, including YouTube videos, photos, and social media posts. When users scroll through the multimedia narrative along the right-hand side of the page, the map responsively zooms to each corresponding location, helping to capture the simultaneity of these digital and physical networks.
