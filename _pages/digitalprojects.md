**Graduate Projects**

During the course of my time at the School of Information Management at Dalhousie University, I participated in INFO 6620: Elextronic Text Design. Below is a portfolio of culminating course projects which demonstrate basic concepts of HTML and CSS design. These two sites have been recreated as static github pages to showcase early interactions with coding and design.

The [INFO 6620 syllabus](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/33597521/info-6620-electronic-text-design-course-outline-faculty-of-) available from 2009,  similar to course work produced in 2012.
