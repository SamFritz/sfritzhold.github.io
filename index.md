Hi, I'm Samantha Fritz, and I am an information professional interested in literacy instruction, information access and usability, web archives, and community engagement. 

Currently I'm the the Project Manager for [Archives Unleashed](harchivesunleashed.org), an [Andrew Mellon](https://mellon.org) funded project which aims to lower barriers of access to and use of web archives. 

I'm proud to be an alumni of the University of Waterloo (Hon. B.A, History & English Literature) and Dalhousie University (Master of Library and Information Studies).

Outside of the academic hub, I'm a martial arts instructor with 20 years experience, enjoy traveling and exploring new places with my trusty camera in tow, and love learning lindy hop dance styles.
